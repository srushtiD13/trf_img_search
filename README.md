# trf_img_search
This code uses color based image retreival. First all the dataset images are converted into HSV format. Then the histogram is calculated and normalised for better resolution. Then the threshold value for comparison is calculated according to comparison in querry img and dataset imgs. 0.3 is subtracted from threshold for getting nearer images.
